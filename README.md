# fabdb

- ```npm start``` and ```node index.js``` will both run index.js

- The current size of the card database is more than 900 cards and growing. This requests 32 pages of cards from the fabdb.net/api.

- This means you cannot run the program more than once per minute.

- To test just comment out the ```for``` loop or divide ```lastPage``` by 4 or 5 inside the ```for``` condition

:D
